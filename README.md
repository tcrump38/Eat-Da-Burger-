# Eat-Da-Burger-

This app logs each burger eaten and added to the field. MVC design pattern, Node, MySQL to query and route data in the app, and Handlebars to generate the HTML. Deployed to Heroku: https://whispering-reaches-99467.herokuapp.com/

Clone the repo to your local machine. Run `npm install` at your root folder. Update `PORT` settings and upload database to MySQL. Run `node server.js`. Open `localhost` in browser.

You can now consume and add burgers to the item list which will persist in the database.
